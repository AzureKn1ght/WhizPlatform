<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Whiz

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://azurekn1ght.github.io/WhizPlatform)

Whiz is a blockchain-based global freelancing platform that offers verified high quality jobs and freelancers at low costs. Whiz does not charge commissions. You can save on what traditional freelance platforms charge as commissions for job matching. Whiz uses blockchains to process and log transactions, including reviews. This translates to authentic and immutable reviews, better quality jobs and freelancers, and cost savings.

Job agreements are written in smart contracts, coupled with payment escrow, onto the blockchain. When you enter a job agreement on Whiz, whether as a hirer or freelancer, the job scope is mutually defined and cannot be changed by either party. Payment is committed by the buyer, but locked away from either party into the smart contract until its fulfilment. Whiz does not have access to these funds at any point in time.

Key Benefits of Whiz:
* Access to Qualified Freelancers Globally
* Smart Contracts ensure Well-Defined Scopes & Payments
* Enjoy Zero Commission Fees, Only Pay For What You Need

In a nutshell, Whiz provides secure, traceable, reliable payments using smart contracts powered and enabled via the blockchain. All your pain points with other freelancing platforms well taken care off!

### Built With

Whiz runs on a hybrid technology stack that employs the blockchain along with modern web technologies. The frontend client is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It is hosted on a web server and can be accessed via web browsers or installed on mobile devices as a progressive web application (PWA).

The backend components are hosted using a state-of-the-art serverless computing architecture by means of the MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Realm services. A secured connection between the business functions in MongoDB Realm and the MongoDB Atlas database allows for the processing of information required for the web application to function. By adopting a serverless architecture, we further lower our overhead operating and maintenance costs resulting in significant efficiency gains.

Key Technologies Used:
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) 
* [MongoDB Realm](https://www.mongodb.com/realm) 
* [web3.js](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js) 
* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) 
* [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org)
* [Polygon](https://polygon.technology)
